# Getting started

My coding journey started back in the summer of 2021.

I studied at [SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/) and [here](/certificates) are all courses I completed.
I started with **C#**, but after a while I had some **JavaScript** courses in my track and got really into it, so I switched and decided to become JS Web Developer.

The most recent technologies I'm learning are [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
